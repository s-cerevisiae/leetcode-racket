# leetcode-racket
My [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Most were written as experiments or for fun, so don't expect them to be optimal. 

## Layout

- Solutions are named as `<id>-<title>.rkt`.
- LeetCode pre-defined types are in separate modules and are `require`d by solutions that use them.
